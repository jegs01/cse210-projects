John 3:16-17 | For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
Proverbs 3:5 | Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
